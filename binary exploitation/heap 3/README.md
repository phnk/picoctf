# Heap 3
This is similar to the previous heap tasks, but now we have an immutable object that is initiated by the program. We also have a new option where we can free the memory where the struct is stored.

This exploit is based on [CVE-2024-8422 (Use after Free)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8422) where we try to use memory that has been freed, meaning that we have undefined behaviour.

The solution is quite simple. We free the memory. We check how much data has to be put before `x->flag` and the we put pico into `x->flag`.

I did this by using a size of 34 and the string `AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHpico`.
