# Heap 1

Looking at the code for heap 1:
```
void check_win() {
    if (!strcmp(safe_var, "pico")) {
        printf("\nYOU WIN\n");

        // Print flag
        char buf[FLAGSIZE_MAX];
        FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        fgets(buf, FLAGSIZE_MAX, fd);
        printf("%s\n", buf);
        fflush(stdout);

        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("Looks like everything is still secure!\n");
        printf("\nNo flage for you :(\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```

The difference from heap 0 to heap 1 is that we now have to put pico in the safe_var (`if (!strcmp(safe_var, "pico")) {`), meaning that we first have to find how much we have to input in order to write over safe_var.

You can calculate it, but the easiest way is just to bruteforce it by inserting AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJKKKKLLLL.... etc.

From this we see that safe_var starts from IIII, hence we have to put AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHpico in order to solve the task.
