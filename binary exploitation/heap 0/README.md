# Heap 0
Here we are allowed to write into the heap. However, the heap is only so long and after the heap we have the safe variable which we should change in order to print the flag.

Solution: Just input a long enough string, such as AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA and we will write over the safe_var and be able to print the flag.
